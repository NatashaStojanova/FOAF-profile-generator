                  available further down the page in the Tabs Section. These options include people you know, social
                  networks to which you may belong, and other additional information described by the FOAF vocabulary.

                  Remember, as with all other online profiles, do not publish any information you wish to keep
                  completely private. This is particularly applicable with informartion such as an email address - which
                  most people do not want to give out in an effort to avoid spam.
